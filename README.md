# Hexgrid-AStar

Hi! This is a small test done showcasing a pathfinding system using a hex-based grid.

For this pathfinder program I used the following resources:
- [About Hexagons](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/),
- [AStar Algorithm](https://learn.unity.com/project/a-36369ng)

## How to Run

Simply clone the repo and run on Unity 2022.x.

Scene "Hex" will contain a board ready with a map and a UI where you can pick your tiles, paint them and re-generate the path.
